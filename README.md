This project is a Python script designed to analyze Python projects hosted on GitHub. It aims to simplify the process of identifying all the external libraries used within a project and checking for known security vulnerabilities associated with those libraries. By parsing the Python files and examining the requirements.txt file, the script extracts the list of dependencies and cross-references them with a security database to detect any issues that may pose risks to the project's integrity and safety.

The primary objectives of this tool are to streamline dependency management, assist in the identification of potential security threats, and provide a clear, actionable report for developers to address any vulnerabilities. This project is intended to help maintain high standards of code security, particularly for open-source projects, by automating security checks and making it easier to spot problematic libraries.
