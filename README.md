Homework 1: Library Usage and Security Analysis
Objective:
Create a Python script that analyzes a public Python project from a GitHub URL, identifies all
used libraries, and checks for known security issues.
Requirements:
1. Command Line Interface:
The script should accept a GitHub URL as a command-line argument.
2. Library Analysis:
Parse all Python files in the project to identify all imported libraries.
Output the list of imported libraries to the console.
Ensure that each library is listed only once in the output.
3. Security Check:
For each identified library, check for known security issues and list them at the end of
the output.
4. Project Constraints:
Your project must contain a requirements.txt file.
5. Documentation:
Add docstrings at each level: package, module, and function.
6. Version Control:
Publish your project in a personal Git repository.
Provide viewing rights to the teachers.
